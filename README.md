# Dashboard
A sports and science fiction display typeface with a humanist touch of drama.

Big fat and wide display typeface that is designed for the dramatic and humorous highlights of the layout. With extra bold and wide glyphs, it's most suitable for big and bold title designs. 

As a first thought, we do expect a geometric/ digital typeface for any kind of high tech action subjects these days. But the characters in this typeface are set to be humorously bold yet high tech enough to be among the big data. Most of the glyphs in this font family have organically adopted shapes from the primary geometric structure.
